### What is the intention behind system design interview?
The interviewer is evaluating:

- Collaboration Skills:
They want to see how well you work with others.
This includes your ability to listen, contribute, and build consensus.
Essentially, can you be a good team player?

- Performance Under Pressure:
They're observing how you handle stressful situations.
Can you remain calm and focused when things get difficult?
Can you still perform well when things are not going smoothly?

- Ability to Resolve Ambiguity:
They're testing your capacity to deal with unclear or vague information.
Can you make sense of incomplete or confusing situations?
Can you find the correct path forward when the path is not obvious.

- Ability to Ask Clarifying Questions:
They want to see if you can identify and address unclear aspects of a task or problem.
Do you know how to ask the right questions to get the information you need?
They are checking if you have the ability to seek out the information that you lack.
